# DCRA_CUSUM

Implementation code for CUSUMs on the [DCRA](https://dica.nl/dcra/home) data set.


This repository aims to make the results from [Inspecting the quality of care: a comparison of CUSUM methods for inter hospital performance](www.google.com) reproducible. 
There is a single subdirectory `R_code`, containing all the code used along with some documentation.
